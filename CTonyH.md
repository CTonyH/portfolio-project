# Hi, I'm Tony 👋

I’m a Junior Frontend Developer from Germany, passionate about building modern, user-friendly web applications.  
Currently, I’m focusing on **Angular**, **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
I recently completed a Frontend Developer program at Developer Akademie in Munich, where I built over 12 projects and deepened my skills in modern web development.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (SCSS), Bootstrap, Material Design  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Firebase, REST APIs, Figma  
- **Workflow:** Agile methods (Scrum, Kanban), clean code practices  

## 🚀 Projects
Here are some highlights – you can find more on my [portfolio website](https://tony-hirschligau.de):

- **Join App**: A task management app inspired by Trello, built with Angular and Firebase.  
- **Pokédex App**: A web app consuming a REST API to display and search Pokémon data.  
- **Jump-and-Run Game**: A browser game developed with object-oriented JavaScript.  

## 🎯 Goals
I want to grow as a developer by working in collaborative teams, learning new frameworks (React, Vue, etc.),  
and I’m also open to exploring backend technologies (Node.js, PHP) to become more versatile.
